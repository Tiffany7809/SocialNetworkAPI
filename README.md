  <h2 id="describe">Description</h2>

  This application is the back end of a social network. Users can add, remove friends, post their thoughts and react to other users posts.

  To solidify my understanding of routes and learn how to use mongo and mongoose. 

  I got a good understanding of using MongoDB rather than SQL in this application. I have discovered that I actually enjoy using Mongo more that SQL..

  I had a hard time getting the users PUT route to work for me, everything else went smoothly..
